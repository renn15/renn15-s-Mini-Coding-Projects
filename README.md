## Machine Learning and Data Analytics
### Cardiotocography (CTG) Analysis
Team TM110's submission for Datathon 2025: Lifeline hosted by EEE@MLDA. Model accepts summary data of a CTG reading (comprises of fetal heart rate and uterine contractions) and determines its condition (normal, suspect, or pathological). Final model employs Histogram-based Gradient Boost (HGB).
